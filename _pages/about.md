I am a Ph.D student in Computer Science with focus in Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I am advised by Prof. [Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/).

Prior my Ph.D journey, I completed my B.S. in Psychology and Statistics & Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prof. [Dov Cohen](http://www.psychology.illinois.edu/people/dovcohen) advised my undergraduate thesis regarding the effect of grammatically gendered language on investors' financial decision.

as a Ph.D student in Computer Science
------
My research interest in Human-Computer Interaction lies at the intersection of human decision-making, learning, and social computing. The direction of my current research is focused on using technology to persuade people with beneficial behaviors, such as active learning and healthy lifestyle, that benefit themselves and the larger group as a whole.

as a darkroom technician
------
I am a darkroom technician at [Urbana Museum of Photography](https://www.facebook.com/UrbanaMuseumOfPhotography/). I use photography as a means to document the world around me and communicate my feelings. Analog photography allows me to express through diverse media. Updates about my projects, and thoughts are in [Remain in Light](https://www.ziangxiao.com/portfolio/)

<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
